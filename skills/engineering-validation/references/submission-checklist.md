# Submission Checklist

Use this for final read-only inspection.

## Last-Pass Order

1. Confirm live draft and input order.
2. Confirm title, author, and blind-review state.
3. Confirm PDF page count and bibliography count.
4. Check thesis, contributions, main results, ablations, and limitations.
5. Check figure/table captions, labels, metric names, and category names.
6. Search for overclaims and AI-looking patterns.
7. Compile and run diff checks.
8. If syncing to a final copy, compile that copy too.

## Final Questions

- What is the biggest remaining risk: logic, format, citation, author state, or
  build?
- Did the last edit reduce that risk?
- Is any claimed completion backed by a command or file inspection?

## Status Labels

- `READY`: all required checks passed
- `NOT_READY`: actionable problem found or a required check failed
- `CANNOT_DETERMINE`: missing files, ambiguous source draft, skipped required
  checks, or command failure prevents validation

Do not use `READY` if any required build, bibliography, page, citation, figure,
or evidence-anchor check was skipped or returned `PARTIAL`, `NOT_RUN`, or
`UNKNOWN`.
