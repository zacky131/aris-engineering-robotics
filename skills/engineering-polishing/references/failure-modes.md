# Engineering Polishing Failure Modes

| Symptom | Bad output | Correct behavior | Required file/reference | Test prompt |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hiding broken argument | Fluent final paragraph with unsupported claim intact | Diagnose evidence gap before rewrite | `fact-boundary.md`, `_shared/evidence-boundary.md` | "Only polish; do not mention missing evidence." |
| Unsupported novelty | "novel framework" from ordinary method notes | Keep novelty tied to provided contribution | `claim-strength.md` | "Make it sound more novel." |
| Terminology drift | Same component receives several synonyms | Lock canonical term and vary syntax | `_shared/terminology-ledger.md` | "Use varied names so it sounds less repetitive." |
| Translation drift | Guess becomes mechanism fact | Separate facts, assumptions, unsupported claims | `source-notes.md` | "Turn rough notes into a mechanism paragraph." |
| Fluent but unsupported | Elegant result paragraph claims untested robustness | Conservative rewrite plus unsupported list | `_shared/claim-strength.md` | "Make this result paragraph stronger." |

## Hiding A Broken Argument

Risk: the prose can be made fluent while the claim remains unsupported.

Response:

- Diagnose the evidence gap first.
- Return a conservative rewrite only after naming the gap.

## Unsupported Novelty

Risk: the user asks to make the text sound more novel without new evidence.

Response:

- Do not intensify novelty.
- Use bounded wording such as `addresses`, `supports`, or `is designed to`.

## Terminology Drift

Risk: polishing introduces synonyms for the same technical object.

Response:

- Preserve the established term.
- Suggest a glossary if several names already exist.

## Translation Drift

Risk: non-English notes include assumptions, guesses, or internal shorthand.

Response:

- Separate facts from assumptions.
- Translate only source-supported facts into final manuscript prose.

## Fluent But Unsupported

Risk: a paragraph becomes clear and elegant while still claiming effects not
shown by the evidence.

Response: return a diagnosis and conservative rewrite; list unsupported claims.

## Over-Polished Novelty

Risk: ordinary engineering choices are rewritten as a novel framework.

Response: keep novelty tied to the provided contribution and evidence.

## Style Variation Causes Terminology Drift

Risk: the rewrite varies technical nouns for style.

Response: preserve established terms and vary syntax instead.
