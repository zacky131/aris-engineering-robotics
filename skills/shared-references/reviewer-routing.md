# Reviewer Routing

## Default Routing

The default reviewer backend depends on the skill AND the execution environment:

| Skill | Default backend | Opt-in override |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| `/auto-review-loop` | **`copilot-native`** when the marker protocol binds the current Copilot CLI root session; otherwise **`codex`** | `--reviewer: codex` / `oracle-pro` / `agy` / `manual`; `--reviewer: copilot` retains the legacy custom-agent drive mode |
| All other reviewer skills | **Codex MCP** (`mcp__codex__codex`), model **`gpt-6-astra`** | `--reviewer: oracle-pro` / `agy` / `manual` |

When no reviewer is specified, `/auto-review-loop` first attempts the
[native marker protocol](#copilot-cli-native-rubber-duck-default-for-auto-review-loop).
It does not depend on the proposed `COPILOT_CLI` environment variable. Two
separate root Bash calls bind a fresh run token to Copilot's persisted session
events and expose the host-reported executor model. Outside Copilot CLI the
challenge cannot bind, so the pre-existing Codex default remains unchanged.

Inside a bound Copilot session, the default is the built-in `rubber-duck`
subagent. Copilot chooses its complementary model dynamically; ARIS never pins
GPT-5.4 or any other fixed reviewer model. A native verdict may stop the loop
only when `copilot_native_evidence.py` revalidates one successful nonce-bound
subagent lifecycle and the host-reported executor/reviewer models are known,
different families. Missing, unknown, same-family, malformed, or stale evidence
fails closed. Explicit reviewer directives continue to select their requested
external backend.

See the [native Copilot section](#copilot-cli-native-rubber-duck-default-for-auto-review-loop), the [legacy custom-agent section](#copilot-cli-custom-agent-profiles-reviewer-copilot-compatibility-drive-mode), and the [Codex section](#codex-capability-fallback-new-reviewer-sessions-only).

### Codex MCP Tiered Reasoning-Effort Policy

When Codex MCP is the active backend (default for all non-auto-review-loop skills, or explicit `--reviewer: codex`), model **`gpt-6-astra`** (GPT-6-Astra) is used with a **two-tier reasoning-effort policy** (since 2026-07-10; `ultra`/`max` need codex-cli ≥ 0.144.1):

| Tier | `model_reasoning_effort` | Which calls |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Deep-audit** | `ultra` | `/proof-checker` · `/kill-argument` (attack / defense / adjudication threads; beast-mode extra axis probes stay `xhigh`) · `/research-review` · `/experiment-audit` · `/paper-claim-audit` · `/result-to-claim` · `/meta-apply` |
| **Regular** | `xhigh` | every other reviewer call — including ALL rounds of `/auto-review-loop` and other multi-round loops (a `codex-reply` cannot change model/effort mid-thread), and per-item fan-outs like `/citation-audit` (per-entry fresh calls would multiply `ultra`'s delegation cost for no verdict gain) |

**Always pin BOTH `model` and `config.model_reasoning_effort` explicitly in the first call of every thread.** Do not rely on the user's `~/.codex/config.toml`: the catalog default effort for gpt-6-astra is `low`, far below the review floor.

`ultra` = deepest reasoning + automatic task delegation — right for one-shot verdict-bearing audits, wrong for per-item loops (slower, pricier). Effort enums accepted by codex-cli ≥ 0.144.1: `none / minimal / low / medium / high / xhigh / max / ultra`. `max` and `ultra` both sit above `xhigh`; ARIS uses `ultra` for the deep-audit tier and does not use `max`.

> **Do not confuse the two "max"es.** ARIS's `— effort: lite|balanced|max|beast` ([effort-contract.md](effort-contract.md)) sets how much WORK the pipeline does; Codex's `model_reasoning_effort: …|max|ultra` sets how hard the REVIEWER thinks. `— effort: max` does NOT imply `model_reasoning_effort: max`.

### Codex capability fallback (new reviewer sessions only)

Resolve the reviewer pair on the **first new Codex session of each tier** in a run, then reuse that resolved pair for later sessions of the same tier. Try the declared pair first (`gpt-6-astra` + `ultra` for deep-audit; `gpt-6-astra` + `xhigh` for regular). Then:

- Only if the call fails **before returning a usable thread** AND the error **explicitly identifies the requested effort as unsupported** (older codex-cli): retry `gpt-6-astra` + `xhigh`. (This step exists only for the deep tier's `ultra` — a regular-tier `xhigh` call skips it; `xhigh` predates 0.144.1.)
- Only if the error **explicitly identifies `gpt-6-astra` as unknown or unavailable** to this account/plan: retry `gpt-5.6-sol` + `xhigh`, then `gpt-5.5` + `xhigh` (skip redundant intermediate steps).
- **NEVER downgrade on** timeout, rate-limit/capacity, authentication, transport/protocol, server, sandbox/tool, context-length, malformed-request, or response-parse errors — a blind downgrade retry there risks double-running (and double-billing) a review that may have gone through.
- **Never run a verdict-bearing review below `xhigh`.** `gpt-5.4` is available only as an explicit user override for legacy/repro runs — it is NOT part of the automatic chain.
- Replies (`codex-reply`) inherit the successful session's model and effort — pass only the saved `threadId` plus the message.
- Trace every attempt, the resolved pair, and the fallback reason (see `review-tracing.md`); the trace records the pair that actually ran, not the target pair.
- If no allowed pair succeeds, emit `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` (or, for a mandatory audit gate, `ERROR`) — never a substantive verdict.
- This automatic chain applies only when no explicit reviewer-model override was supplied.

### Optional HTTP API fallback for Codex pre-dispatch failures

Claude Code + ARIS Skills may use the existing `llm-chat` MCP as an **opt-in
transport fallback** when the Codex reviewer cannot be started safely. This does
not replace the Codex capability chain above and it is disabled by default.
The user must explicitly configure the `llm-chat` server with
`LLM_REVIEW_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`; only then does it expose
`mcp__llm-chat__review` and `mcp__llm-chat__review_reply`. The legacy
`mcp__llm-chat__chat` tool by itself is **not** a verdict-bearing fallback.
This transport fallback applies to Codex **MCP** review calls; Codex-exec
nightmare-mode behavior is unchanged.

#### Safe switch boundary

The fallback is intentionally **pre-dispatch-only**, matching ARIS-Code's
reviewer fallback safety rule:

- First apply the Codex model/effort capability fallback above.
- HTTP fallback MAY run when the Codex path is known not to have produced a
  review: the Codex MCP tool is absent/unregistered, the local MCP process
  cannot spawn or initialize, or an error explicitly proves the reviewer
  request was rejected before model execution.
- HTTP fallback MUST NOT run merely because a dispatched Codex call timed out,
  disconnected, returned an ambiguous transport/server/parse failure, or
  otherwise might have executed without returning a usable thread. Keep the
  existing `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` / `ERROR` behavior in those cases; silently
  issuing a second paid review risks double-running and conflicting verdicts.
- The existing `NEVER downgrade on ...` list above remains authoritative. An
  error from that list may activate HTTP fallback only when the error itself
  positively establishes that no model request was dispatched.

This boundary is deliberately narrower than "Codex returned any error." Users
who explicitly want a different reviewer regardless of Codex state should pick
that backend directly (`oracle-pro`, `agy`, or `manual`) instead of relying on
fallback.

#### HTTP fallback call contract

For a fresh fallback review, use:

```
mcp__llm-chat__review:
  prompt: [same substantive review task Codex would receive]
  executor_model: <actual executor model id>
  files:
    - <primary artifact path 1>
    - <primary artifact path 2>
```

Do **not** pass Codex-only fields such as `config.model_reasoning_effort`,
`sandbox`, `approval-policy`, `cwd`, `threadId`, base/developer instructions, or
other Codex transport parameters. `llm-chat` reads each explicit `files:` entry
locally and sends the primary artifact contents verbatim to the configured HTTP
endpoint; this is necessary because a remote OpenAI-compatible API cannot read
local Linux paths. Pass primary artifacts, not executor-written summaries, per
`reviewer-independence.md`.

For every follow-up after the HTTP fallback owns the reviewer thread — including
round 2+ and a hard-mode rebuttal ruling in the same round — use:

```
mcp__llm-chat__review_reply:
  threadId: <saved llm-chat threadId>
  prompt: [follow-up review task]
  files:
    - <changed/current primary artifacts the reviewer must inspect>
```

`review_reply` carries the prior user/reviewer exchanges in the MCP server, so
multi-round skills do not silently lose continuity when the fallback activates.

For `/auto-review-loop`, a safe HTTP fallback means the HTTP reviewer is the
backend that actually ran the current round. **Before the HTTP call**, replace
the current-round snapshot as well as the forward-looking backend:

```
REVIEWER_BACKEND=llm-chat
round_backend=llm-chat
round_requires_external_acquittal=false
```

Then pass the returned `reviewer_model` (not merely the requested alias) to
`review_gate.py --round-backend llm-chat`. The fallback is not a Copilot
compatibility finalizer and must not inherit a stale external-acquittal
obligation from some unrelated round.

The HTTP reviewer transport fails closed unless it can derive known, different
families for `executor_model` and the **actual reviewer model**. The response
includes `reviewer_model`, `reviewer_family`, `executor_model`,
`executor_family`, and `independence_verified`. Prefer the provider-reported
model id when available; if the configured HTTP provider internally switches to
`LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL`, trace the model that actually served the review. Missing,
unknown, ambiguous, or same-family identity is `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` for an
acceptance gate.

#### Configuration and privacy

Example Claude Code registration:

```bash
claude mcp add llm-chat -s user \
  --env LLM_API_KEY=<key> \
  --env LLM_BASE_URL=https://example.com/v1 \
  --env LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro \
  --env LLM_REVIEW_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true \
  -- python3 /path/to/mcp-servers/llm-chat/server.py
```

Restart Claude Code after changing MCP configuration. Enabling this fallback
means the explicit primary artifacts passed in `files:` are sent to the
configured third-party HTTP endpoint. Keep it disabled for repositories whose
contents must not leave the machine/provider boundary.

Trace the failed Codex attempt and the HTTP call separately. The verdict trace
must name backend `llm-chat`, the actual returned reviewer model, its family,
and the reason the safe fallback activated. If `mcp__llm-chat__review` is not
available, its call fails, or cross-family identity cannot be verified, emit
`REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` (or `ERROR` for a mandatory gate) exactly as before.

### After upgrading codex-cli

MCP servers are spawned per session: after upgrading codex-cli (e.g. to 0.144.1 for `ultra`/`max`), **restart the Claude Code session** so the `codex` MCP server (`mcp-servers/codex-exec/server.py`, which runs `codex exec`) picks up the new binary — an old server process rejects the new effort enums even though the CLI on disk is new.

## Optional: GPT-5.5 Pro via Oracle

When the user explicitly passes `— reviewer: oracle-pro`, route the review through Oracle MCP instead of Codex MCP.

### Routing Logic (add to any reviewer-invoking skill)

```
Parse $ARGUMENTS for `— reviewer:` directive.

If not specified OR `— reviewer: codex`:
    → Use mcp__codex__codex with model: gpt-6-astra at the tier's effort
      (deep-audit: ultra / regular: xhigh — see the Default table above).
    → This is the DEFAULT. No change from current behavior.

If `— reviewer: oracle-pro`:
    → Check if mcp__oracle__consult tool is available
    → If available:
        Use mcp__oracle__consult with:
          model: "gpt-5.5-pro"
          prompt: [same prompt you would send to Codex]
          files: [file paths for reviewer to read directly]
        Note: Oracle may use API mode (fast, needs OPENAI_API_KEY)
              or browser mode (slow ~1-2 min, needs Chrome + ChatGPT login)
    → If NOT available:
        Print: "⚠️ Oracle MCP not installed. Falling back to Codex at this call's declared tier."
        Use mcp__codex__codex as normal.
```

### Invariants

- `— reviewer: oracle-pro` ONLY takes effect when explicitly passed
- Reviewer independence protocol still applies (pass file paths, not summaries)
- `effort` and `difficulty` are orthogonal — they don't change reviewer backend
- `beast` mode may RECOMMEND oracle-pro but never requires it
- Browser mode: acceptable for one-shot reviews; NOT recommended inside multi-round loops (too slow/brittle)

### Oracle MCP Call Format

```
mcp__oracle__consult:
  prompt: |
    [role + task + output schema]
    Read all listed files directly.
  model: "gpt-5.5-pro"
  files:
    - /absolute/path/to/file1
    - /absolute/path/to/file2
```

### Skills That Support `— reviewer: oracle-pro`

| Skill | Use case for Pro |
|-------|-----------------|
| `/research-review` | Deeper critique on paper drafts |
| `/auto-review-loop` | Final stress test (last round only in browser mode) |
| `/experiment-audit` | Line-by-line eval code audit |
| `/proof-checker` | Deep mathematical reasoning |
| `/rebuttal` | Stress test before submission |
| `/idea-creator` | Idea evaluation depth |
| `/research-lit` | Literature analysis depth |

### Installation

```bash
# Install Oracle CLI + MCP
npm install -g @steipete/oracle

# Add Oracle MCP to Claude Code
claude mcp add oracle -s user -- oracle-mcp

# Restart Claude Code session to load

# API mode (fast, recommended):
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Browser mode (no API key, slower):
# Just log in to ChatGPT in Chrome
```

### NOT installed = ZERO impact

If Oracle is not installed, `— reviewer: oracle-pro` gracefully falls back to Codex. No error, no breakage, just a warning.

### Upstream development & known issues

Oracle MCP is maintained at [`steipete/oracle`](https://github.com/steipete/oracle). When you invoke `— reviewer: oracle-pro` (and especially the `o3-deep-research` / `gpt-5.5-pro` paths), it's worth checking the **[open PRs](https://github.com/steipete/oracle/pulls)** for in-flight fixes that may affect your run — e.g., model routing changes, browser-mode auth fixes, rate-limit handling, or new model alias support. ARIS does not vendor Oracle MCP; you're running the published version from `npm install -g @steipete/oracle`. If a behavior surprises you, the upstream PR queue is the first place to check before opening an issue here.

## Optional: Gemini via Antigravity CLI (`— reviewer: agy`)

When the user explicitly passes `— reviewer: agy`, route the review through the **gemini-review MCP** with the Antigravity (`agy`) backend — a native cross-model reviewer for Antigravity users who don't run Codex MCP / Oracle. Added in [#267](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/pull/267).

### Routing Logic (add to any reviewer-invoking skill)

```
Parse $ARGUMENTS for `— reviewer:` directive.

If `— reviewer: agy`:
    → Check if the gemini-review MCP tool is available (mcp__gemini-review__review).
    → If available (server configured with GEMINI_REVIEW_BACKEND=agy):
        Use mcp__gemini-review__review with:
          prompt: [same prompt you would send to Codex]
        For round 2+: mcp__gemini-review__review_reply with the saved threadId.
        For long paper/project reviews (avoid the ~120s MCP tool timeout):
          mcp__gemini-review__review_start + mcp__gemini-review__review_status (async).
    → If NOT available:
        Print: "⚠️ gemini-review (agy) MCP not configured. Falling back to Codex at this call's declared tier."
        Use mcp__codex__codex as normal.
```

### Invariants

- `— reviewer: agy` ONLY takes effect when explicitly passed.
- **Cross-model family holds by construction.** The `agy` backend is fail-closed on ARIS's invariant: it recovers the *actual* Gemini-family model id from the current invocation's Antigravity transcript, **refuses** to return a verdict if the routed model is non-Gemini (no `"agy-cli"` placeholder), and binds the recovered transcript to *this* call via a **user-event nonce** (a model echo can't spoof the binding). So when the executor is Claude, `— reviewer: agy` (Gemini) satisfies the cross-model gate.
- Reviewer independence still applies — pass prompt context only (the `tools` arg is accepted for compatibility but ignored).
- `effort` and `difficulty` are orthogonal — they don't change the reviewer backend.

### Install

```bash
# Install + authenticate the Antigravity CLI (`agy`), then add the MCP with the agy backend:
claude mcp add gemini-review --env GEMINI_REVIEW_BACKEND=agy -- python3 <path>/mcp-servers/gemini-review/server.py
# (codex mcp add gemini-review ... for Codex CLI). Without the env var the server defaults to the direct Gemini API.
```

### NOT installed = ZERO impact

If the gemini-review (agy) MCP isn't configured, `— reviewer: agy` gracefully falls back to Codex at the call's declared tier (deep-audit: ultra / regular: xhigh). No error, no breakage, just a warning.

## Optional: Manual Review (any classifiable model, zero API cost)

When the user explicitly passes `— reviewer: manual`, route the review through the manual-review MCP server. Instead of calling an API, it opens a browser page (or writes a file on headless Linux) where the user copies the prompt to a model of their choice and pastes the response back. The reviewer model must be one ARIS can classify by family (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Moonshot/Kimi, Qwen); an unclassifiable name cannot be shown to differ from the executor's.

**Zero API cost. Works with any text-capable model.**

### Routing Logic

```
Parse $ARGUMENTS for `— reviewer:` directive.

If `— reviewer: manual`:
    → Check if mcp__manual_review__review tool is available
    → If available:
        Use mcp__manual_review__review with:
          prompt: [same review prompt you would send to Codex; the manual
                   transport wrapper also requires the response's first line
                   to be `Reviewer-Model: <exact-model-id>`]
          config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh", "executor_model": "<actual executor model>", "require_reviewer_model": true}
        For round 2+ in multi-round skills:
          Use mcp__manual_review__review_reply with:
            threadId: [saved from prior call]
            prompt: [follow-up prompt]
            config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh", "executor_model": "<actual executor model>", "require_reviewer_model": true}
    → If NOT available:
        Print: "⚠️ Manual Review MCP not installed. Install with: claude mcp add manual-review -s user -- python3 /path/to/mcp-servers/manual-review/server.py"
        STOP. Do NOT fall back to Codex (the target user likely has no Codex subscription).
```

### Invariants

- `— reviewer: manual` ONLY takes effect when explicitly passed
- **Cross-model family is mandatory, not optional.** "a model of their choice" above means any *classifiable, non-executor-family* model, determined dynamically from the actual executor model — not merely "non-Claude." Every verdict-bearing response must start with `Reviewer-Model: <exact-model-id>`; derive its family and compare it with the model-derived executor family. Missing, unknown, ambiguous, or same-family identity is `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` for an acceptance gate. The UI warning is advisory; the traced model identities and derivation are the gate.
- Prompt fidelity: the review task text is exactly what Codex would receive; the manual transport wrapper may add only the model-identity response-format line used by the provenance gate
- `config.model_reasoning_effort` is shown as a recommendation badge, not embedded in the prompt
- Thread continuity: `review_reply` shows previous exchanges so the user can maintain context in their chosen model
- Reviewer independence protocol still applies

### Thread continuity

For round 2+ in multi-round skills (`/auto-review-loop`, `/proof-checker` Phase 3):
- Use `mcp__manual_review__review_reply` with the saved `threadId`
- The browser page displays previous prompt/response exchanges
- The user should continue the conversation in the same model session for best results

### Installation

```bash
claude mcp add manual-review -s user -- python3 /path/to/mcp-servers/manual-review/server.py
```

### Modes

- **Browser mode** (default): opens a local web page on Windows/macOS/Linux desktop
- **File mode** (`MANUAL_REVIEW_MODE=file`): writes prompt to a per-thread subdirectory. Read `.aris/pending_review/pending_review.json` for the `prompt_file` and `response_file` paths — for headless/SSH environments

### Skills That Support `— reviewer: manual`

The following skills are wired for manual review (Claude Code only):

| Skill | Manual support |
|-------|----------------|
| `/research-review` | Yes |
| `/auto-review-loop` | Yes |
| `/experiment-audit` | Yes |
| `/proof-checker` | Yes |
| `/rebuttal` | Yes |
| `/idea-creator` | Yes |

> `/research-lit` supports `oracle-pro` only; manual review is not wired because the skill has no reviewer call blocks.

> **Platform note**: Manual review requires MCP tools (available only in Claude Code). Mirrored skill packs under `skills/skills-codex/` and `skills/skills-codex-*-review/` do NOT include manual-review wiring — they target Codex CLI and other platforms that lack MCP support. Oracle-pro support in those mirrors is unaffected.

### Nightmare mode (Codex-only)

Manual review supports medium/hard MCP-style review. Codex-exec nightmare mode is Codex-only and must fail closed when reviewer is manual.

### NOT installed = explicit error (not silent fallback)

If manual-review MCP is not installed, `— reviewer: manual` prints install instructions and stops. It does NOT fall back to Codex — the target user likely has no Codex subscription, so a silent fallback would fail anyway.

### `codex exec` CLI is NOT an equivalent Codex backend

The mainline reviewer contract is `mcp__codex__codex` + `mcp__codex__codex-reply`: skills rely on **thread continuity** (e.g. `/idea-creator` Phase 4 runs its devil's-advocate triage as a same-thread `codex-reply`), structured returns, and saved `threadId` traces. `codex exec --ephemeral` is a stateless one-shot — fine for a single self-contained review, but NOT a drop-in replacement: hand-rewriting every MCP call to `codex exec` silently loses reply continuity and tends to mangle SKILL.md instructions (observed in the wild as "the executor skips phases and improvises" — issue #284).

If Codex MCP is broken in your setup, prefer in order:

1. Fix the MCP registration: `claude mcp add codex -s user -- python3 "$HOME/aris_repo/mcp-servers/codex-exec/server.py"` (codex-cli 0.154 removed `codex mcp-server`; the bridge replaces it — verified on 0.153.4 and 0.154.0, needs `codex exec resume`), then `/mcp` in-session to (re)connect.
2. Codex-CLI-as-executor: use the native mirror pack [`skills/skills-codex/`](../skills-codex/) — designed to run inside Codex CLI without Claude-side MCP.
3. One-shot `codex exec` only for skills whose review is a single call with no follow-up reply.

## Copilot CLI Native Rubber Duck (default for auto-review-loop)

This is the automatic Copilot path requested by #258. It uses Copilot CLI's
built-in `rubber-duck` **subagent**, not a second `copilot` process, a slash
prompt, or a top-level `--agent rubber-duck` session. Copilot's complementary
model strategy selects an available opposite-family model at dispatch time.
ARIS does not request a fixed model and accepts the review only after reading
the actual executor and reviewer model IDs from the native session lifecycle.

### Activation and explicit overrides

Parse `--reviewer:` before probing the host:

- An explicit `codex`, `oracle-pro`, `agy`, or `manual` directive uses that
  external backend directly. Do not run the native probe first.
- Explicit `copilot` retains the compatibility custom-agent drive described
  later in this file.
- With no directive, resolve `copilot_native_evidence.py` through the canonical
  four-layer helper chain. Run `marker` and `challenge` as **two separate root
  Bash tool calls**. Exit 3 from `challenge` means no current Copilot root
  session was bound; continue with the existing Codex default.
- A bound challenge selects `reviewer_backend: copilot-native` and records the
  host-reported executor identity. No `COPILOT_CLI` environment variable and no
  caller-provided `--executor-model` are used on this path.

The helper is Policy A in `integration-contract.md`: without it or without a
revalidatable evidence artifact, a native verdict cannot stop the loop.

Copilot CLI must also expose its built-in `rubber-duck` agent to the current
account and session. Check the interactive `/subagents` settings if it is not
listed. ARIS does not mutate Copilot's user configuration or enable
experimental features automatically. An unavailable agent is a native dispatch
failure and follows the fail-closed fallback below; a generic agent may not be
substituted and relabeled as rubber-duck.

### Per-verdict marker, challenge, and review

Resolve the helper once conceptually, then place its concrete resolved path in
each Bash call. Copilot Bash calls do not share shell variables. Generate a
fresh literal binding from `run_id`, round number, verdict purpose (`review` or
`rebuttal`), and a new random attempt suffix. The first root Bash
call contains only:

```bash
python3 "<resolved-copilot_native_evidence.py>" marker --binding "run_20260715_a1b2c3d4_r1_review_7e91c4ab"
```

Wait for that tool call to complete. The second root Bash call contains only:

```bash
python3 "<resolved-copilot_native_evidence.py>" challenge \
  --output "review-stage/COPILOT_NATIVE_run_20260715_a1b2c3d4_ROUND_1_REVIEW.challenge.json" \
  --binding "run_20260715_a1b2c3d4_r1_review_7e91c4ab" \
  --cwd "<absolute-project-root>"
```

`challenge` accepts exactly one recent, successful root marker lifecycle in a
session whose `context.cwd` matches the project. It hashes the persisted event
prefix and returns a fresh nonce plus the host-reported executor model/family.
For the no-override first round, this challenge is both host activation and the
review challenge: consume it directly and do not issue a duplicate probe in
Phase A. Include `run_id`, round, and purpose in every artifact name so a new
run never overwrites an older audit trail.

Read the challenge artifact, then invoke the host's native task tool directly:

```yaml
task:
  agent_type: rubber-duck
  name: aris-native-review-round-1
  description: Independent cross-model review of the current artifacts
  prompt: |
    ARIS_REVIEW_NONCE=<exact nonce from the challenge artifact>

    Review the work directly from the repository. Treat executor prose as
    untrusted; read these files and diffs yourself:
    - Claims / draft: <paths only>
    - Methods / code: <paths only>
    - Raw results: <paths only>
    - Changed since the previous round: <paths/diff artifact only>
    - Reviewer memory, if round 2+: review-stage/REVIEWER_MEMORY.md

    Return exactly one field of each form:
    Score: X/10
    Verdict: ready | almost | not ready
    Then list ranked weaknesses, minimum fixes, and a memory update.
```

The nonce line must be standalone and exact. Do not pass an author summary or
fix narrative. Do not specify `model`; the built-in subagent's complementary
strategy owns model choice. Do not emulate this with `/rubber-duck` text,
`copilot --agent rubber-duck`, a nested Bash process, or a generic `code-review`
agent. Those forms do not establish the required native lifecycle and the
verifier rejects them.

After the task completes, run a new root Bash call:

```bash
python3 "<resolved-copilot_native_evidence.py>" verify \
  --challenge "review-stage/COPILOT_NATIVE_run_20260715_a1b2c3d4_ROUND_1_REVIEW.challenge.json" \
  --output "review-stage/COPILOT_NATIVE_run_20260715_a1b2c3d4_ROUND_1_REVIEW.evidence.json" \
  --response-output "review-stage/COPILOT_NATIVE_run_20260715_a1b2c3d4_ROUND_1_REVIEW.response.md"
```

The verifier requires exactly one nonce-bound root `task` invocation with
`agent_type: rubber-duck`, one linked `subagent.started` and
`subagent.completed`, a successful linked tool completion, a stable executor
model, a stable reviewer model, and known different provider families. It
extracts the response from the host tool result; executor-written response text
is never accepted as a substitute. The evidence ID binds the event prefix,
lifecycle IDs, models, and response hash. Later append-only session events are
allowed; changes to the bound prefix are not.

The Copilot session log is host-session-event provenance, not a cryptographic
signature against a malicious local user. Trace it as
`identity_assurance: host_event_verified`, with both model sources set to
`host-session-event`.

### Fail-closed fallback

Failure to dispatch `rubber-duck` (including when it is absent from Copilot's
current `/subagents` list), `complementary_model_unavailable`, an
incomplete lifecycle, unknown/same-family models, a response without exactly
one anchored Score and Verdict, or failed evidence validation can never produce
acceptance.

- If the challenge never bound a Copilot session, use the ordinary Codex
  default. This preserves behavior in Claude Code and other hosts.
- If the challenge bound and reports an Anthropic/Google executor, but native
  complementary review is unavailable, use Codex only when that backend is
  positively available.
- If the bound executor is OpenAI-family, Codex is not an independent fallback;
  use manual review only when it is available and reports a known non-OpenAI
  model identity.
- If no known opposite-family backend is available, emit `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`.

Before selecting a fallback, run `copilot_native_evidence.py
validate-challenge --challenge <round-challenge>` and derive the executor
family only from its revalidated host-event model. A fallback is not a native
verdict: trace the failed native attempt, clear native evidence, and label the
actual Codex/manual call as the current round backend. Set the existing
external-acquittal obligation so `review_gate.py` re-derives the fallback
reviewer's family and refuses a same/unknown pair. "Available" means that the
backend returned a usable review (and, for manual, its required exact model
identity), not merely that a command or tool name was present.

Fallback is allowed only before a native verdict is accepted. Trace the failed
native attempt and the backend that actually ran. Never relabel an external
fallback as `copilot-native`.

### Stop and continuity rules

Every verdict-bearing native call uses exactly one fresh marker/challenge/nonce
and a fresh rubber-duck subagent. Round-to-round continuity remains the
append-only `review-stage/REVIEWER_MEMORY.md` artifact, which the next reviewer
reads directly. A verdict-bearing rebuttal ruling likewise needs its own
challenge and evidence with purpose `REBUTTAL`; it must not overwrite or reuse
the round's `REVIEW` artifacts.

Pass the verified artifact to `review_gate.py --native-evidence <path>`. The
gate revalidates it and parses the Score/Verdict from the bound raw response.
For `copilot-native`, a qualifying positive verdict stops directly—no Codex or
manual finalizer. A negative verdict continues on `copilot-native`. Any missing
or mismatched evidence produces `review_unavailable`.

Trace native calls with `save_trace.sh --backend copilot-native
--native-evidence <path>`. The trace helper revalidates the artifact and derives
the actual model pair, response, evidence ID, sources, family relation, and
`independence_verified: true`; caller-supplied model/family claims cannot
override it.

## Copilot CLI Custom Agent Profiles (`--reviewer: copilot` compatibility drive mode)

**Scope: explicit compatibility path for `/auto-review-loop` only.** It does NOT claim to support all reviewer skills. Other skills (research-review, experiment-audit, proof-checker, rebuttal, idea-creator) are not wired and continue to use Codex MCP regardless of the `--reviewer: copilot` flag.

Copilot CLI with custom agent profiles is an **explicit opt-in** reviewer backend for `/auto-review-loop`. Pass `--reviewer: copilot` to use the documented `copilot --agent` subprocess with custom agent profiles for review instead of an external MCP server. The `COPILOT_CLI` environment variable is not used for auto-detection (it is an open proposal, github/copilot-cli#2107, not a shipped feature).

**This is not the no-flag default.** In a bound Copilot session the default is
`copilot-native`; outside Copilot it is `codex`. Pass `--reviewer: copilot` only
to request this older subprocess drive mode explicitly.

### Prerequisites — Custom Agent Profiles

Copilot CLI uses custom agent profiles (declared in `.github/agents/` or equivalent) to pin reviewer models. Two profiles are required:

| Profile name | Pinned model | Model family | File |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `aris-reviewer-openai` | `gpt-5.4` | `openai` | `.github/agents/aris-reviewer-openai.agent.md` |
| `aris-reviewer-claude` | `claude-sonnet-4.5` | `anthropic` | `.github/agents/aris-reviewer-claude.agent.md` |

Both profiles must exist and be loadable by the Copilot CLI (`copilot --agent`). If a profile file is missing, emit `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` with the missing profile path — the user must create it before the copilot reviewer can function.

### Opposite-Family Routing (MANDATORY — identity assurance is limited)

The selected reviewer model family MUST differ from the family derived from the declared executor model. Same-family routing is forbidden. However, the current Copilot CLI integration cannot independently attest the parent executor's actual model, so this is a fail-closed routing rule—not proof of runtime independence.

Unlike the previous broken model-inheritance approach, the router reads the selected profile's `model:` field and passes that same value through the subprocess-level `--model` flag. This outer pin is mandatory because Copilot CLI may ignore a custom agent's model when the session model is Auto.

**Family detection requires `--executor-model`:**

The skill MUST receive `--executor-model` as a parameter. From it, derive `executor_family`:
- Model names containing `gpt`, `o1`, `o3`, `o4`, `chatgpt` → `openai`
- Model names containing `claude`, `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku` → `anthropic`
- Model names containing `gemini` → `google`
- Anything else → `unknown`

**Router rule — pick the OPPOSITE family profile:**

```
executor_family = openai  → reviewer_profile = "aris-reviewer-claude"  (anthropic)
executor_family = anthropic → reviewer_profile = "aris-reviewer-openai" (openai)
executor_family = google  → reviewer_profile = "aris-reviewer-openai"  (openai, default cross-family)
executor_family = unknown → REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE. Stop. "Cannot determine executor model family.
                            Supply --executor-model <model> to identify the executor model."
```

This selects an opposite-family reviewer relative to the declared executor identity. If that declaration is missing or its family cannot be determined, fail closed. Do not describe the result as independently verified.

### Identity Declaration and Evidence Limits — `--executor-model`

The auto-review-loop SKILL.md MUST accept `--executor-model <model>` as a parameter. This is NOT optional when `--reviewer: copilot` is used. It is the available routing input, but it is caller-declared—not an independently attested runtime identity.

**In the state JSON (`REVIEW_STATE.json`) and every trace, record:**

```json
{
  "executor_model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "executor_model_source": "caller-declared",
  "executor_family": "anthropic",
  "reviewer_profile": "aris-reviewer-openai",
  "requested_reviewer_model": "gpt-5.4",
  "reported_reviewer_model": "<model the copilot CLI actually reports using, if available>",
  "reviewer_model_source": "requested",
  "reviewer_family": "openai",
  "family_relation": "different",
  "independence_verified": "unverified"
}
```

- `executor_model` comes from `--executor-model`; record `executor_model_source: "caller-declared"`.
- `executor_family` is derived from `executor_model` via the rules above.
- `reviewer_profile` is the profile name selected by the router.
- `requested_reviewer_model` is read from the selected profile file and passed explicitly with `--model`.
- `reported_reviewer_model` is what the Copilot CLI reports (for example through a captured `gen_ai.response.model` OpenTelemetry attribute), if available; otherwise it is `"unavailable"`.
- `reviewer_family` is derived from `reported_reviewer_model` (if available) or `requested_reviewer_model`; caller-supplied family labels are never trusted.
- `family_relation` is `different`, `same`, or `unknown`, derived from the two model strings.
- `independence_verified` is `false` for a known same-family pair and `"unverified"` when the pair differs but the executor identity is caller-declared. Different strings alone never produce `true`.

**Fail closed when:**
- `--executor-model` is missing AND `--reviewer: copilot` is used → `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`.
- `executor_family` is `unknown` → `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`.
- The selected profile file does not exist → `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`.
- The profile has no non-empty `model:` field, or the derived reviewer family is unknown/same-family → `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`.
- `copilot --help` does not advertise `--model`, `--effort`, and `--allow-tool` → `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`; do not silently run an older unpinned CLI.
- `family_relation` is `same` or `unknown` → `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` for Copilot routing. `family_relation: different` is usable for drive routing but remains `independence_verified: "unverified"`.

### Routing Logic

```
Parse $ARGUMENTS for `--reviewer:` and `--executor-model` directives.

If `--reviewer: copilot` (explicit opt-in):
    → Require `--executor-model`. If missing:
        Print: "⚠️ --reviewer: copilot requires --executor-model <model> for
                opposite-family routing (identity remains caller-declared)."
        Emit REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE. Stop.
    → Derive executor_family from --executor-model.
    → If executor_family is unknown:
        Print: "⚠️ Cannot determine model family for executor model '<model>'.
                Known families: openai (gpt, o1, o3, o4, chatgpt),
                anthropic (claude, sonnet, opus, haiku), google (gemini)."
        Emit REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE. Stop.
    → Select reviewer_profile = opposite family profile (see table above).
    → Verify the profile file exists (e.g., .github/agents/<profile>.agent.md).
      If missing:
        Print: "⚠️ Custom agent profile '<profile>.agent.md' not found.
                Create it at .github/agents/<profile>.agent.md with model: <model>."
        Emit REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE. Stop.
    → Read the first frontmatter `model:` value as requested_reviewer_model.
      Derive reviewer_family from that model string and confirm it differs from
      executor_family. Never trust a free-form model_family field.
    → Verify `copilot` CLI is available (`command -v copilot`). If not:
        Print: "⚠️ --reviewer: copilot requires Copilot CLI (`copilot` command)."
        Emit REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE. Do NOT silently change the requested drive
        transport to Codex/manual. This does not remove the separately
        documented requirement for a Codex/manual finalizer after a positive
        Copilot verdict.
    → Verify the CLI supports `--model`, `--effort`, and `--allow-tool`.
    → Use `copilot --agent` with the selected profile, the parsed model,
      `--effort xhigh`, and read-only tool permission for each review round.

If no `--reviewer:` specified:
    → Use the native marker/challenge protocol documented above.
    → Bound Copilot session: use `copilot-native` rubber-duck.
    → No bound Copilot session: use Codex MCP (`codex` backend), preserving
      the pre-Copilot behavior in other hosts.
    → Do not infer the host from the unshipped `COPILOT_CLI` proposal.
```

### Copilot Subprocess Review Call

For the copilot reviewer, use the documented `copilot --agent` subprocess form with custom agent profiles:

```bash
# PROFILE_FILE is the router-selected .agent.md file.
REVIEWER_MODEL="$(python3 - "$PROFILE_FILE" <<'PY'
import pathlib, sys
lines = pathlib.Path(sys.argv[1]).read_text(encoding="utf-8").splitlines()
models = []
if lines and lines[0].strip() == "---":
    for line in lines[1:]:
        if line.strip() == "---":
            break
        if line.startswith("model:"):
            models.append(line.split(":", 1)[1].strip().strip("\"'"))
if len(models) == 1:
    print(models[0])
PY
)"
[[ -n "$REVIEWER_MODEL" ]] || { echo "REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE: profile has no model" >&2; exit 1; }
COPILOT_HELP="$(copilot --help 2>&1)" || { echo "REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE: copilot unavailable" >&2; exit 1; }
for required_flag in --model --effort --allow-tool; do
  grep -q -- "$required_flag" <<<"$COPILOT_HELP" || {
    echo "REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE: copilot lacks $required_flag" >&2
    exit 1
  }
done

# Build the complete round prompt as a data file using the host's file-writing
# API. Never render untrusted paths/content into shell source.
REVIEW_TASK_FILE="review-stage/ROUND_${ROUND}_COPILOT_PROMPT.md"
[[ -f "$REVIEW_TASK_FILE" ]] || { echo "REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE: missing prompt artifact" >&2; exit 1; }
PROMPTFILE="$(mktemp)" || { echo "REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE: mktemp failed" >&2; exit 1; }
trap 'rm -f "$PROMPTFILE"' EXIT
cat -- "$REVIEW_TASK_FILE" > "$PROMPTFILE"
copilot --agent "$REVIEWER_PROFILE" --model "$REVIEWER_MODEL" \
  --effort xhigh --allow-tool=read --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPTFILE")"
```

The profile name is the router-selected opposite-family profile (`aris-reviewer-openai` or `aris-reviewer-claude`).

**VERIFIED:** `copilot --agent NAME --prompt "..."` is the documented subprocess invocation form per GitHub Copilot CLI docs. Custom agent profiles (`.agent.md` files in `.github/agents/`) are discovered automatically.

**VERIFIED:** `copilot --agent` runs synchronously (like `codex exec`), returning the response to stdout. Multi-round state is maintained via a reviewer-owned memory artifact, not a persistent subagent handle.

### Multi-Round Continuity

`copilot --agent` does **not** expose a persistent thread/agent handle (no equivalent to `threadId` or `agentId`). For multi-round review (`/auto-review-loop`):

1. **Each round is a fresh `copilot --agent` call** with the same profile.
2. **Reviewer memory is carried via one canonical written artifact** (`review-stage/REVIEWER_MEMORY.md`), passed as context in each round's prompt. The reviewer writes to this artifact at the end of each round.
3. The executor appends the reviewer's raw response to `review-stage/REVIEWER_MEMORY.md`, then includes that same artifact in the next round's prompt. There is no project-root fallback.

**Pattern for round 2+:**

First use the host's **Write tool**—never Bash, `echo`, a heredoc, or generated
shell assignments—to overwrite
`review-stage/CURRENT_REVIEW_INPUTS.md`. Store the exact changed paths, diff
artifact/range, and updated result paths under static labels. Those values may
contain arbitrary repository-controlled bytes and must remain file data.

```bash
# ARIS_ROUND2_COPILOT_BEGIN
# Dynamic values were written with the Write tool; shell only reads them as data.
MEMORY_FILE="review-stage/REVIEWER_MEMORY.md"
ROUND_INPUT_FILE="review-stage/CURRENT_REVIEW_INPUTS.md"
[[ -f "$MEMORY_FILE" && -f "$ROUND_INPUT_FILE" ]] || {
  echo "REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE: missing reviewer memory or round inputs" >&2
  exit 1
}
PROMPTFILE="$(mktemp)" || { echo "REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE: mktemp failed" >&2; exit 1; }
trap 'rm -f "$PROMPTFILE"' EXIT
{
cat <<'ARIS_MEMORY_HEADER'
[Round N/MAX_ROUNDS]

## Your Memory From Previous Rounds
ARIS_MEMORY_HEADER
cat -- "$MEMORY_FILE"
cat <<'ARIS_MEMORY_FOOTER'

## Current State
Since your last review these files changed — read them yourself:
ARIS_MEMORY_FOOTER
cat -- "$ROUND_INPUT_FILE"
cat <<'ARIS_MEMORY_INSTRUCTIONS'

Please re-score and re-assess. Are the remaining concerns addressed?
Same format: Score, Verdict, Remaining Weaknesses, Minimum Fixes.

At the end of your review, write (or append to) the Memory Update section
in your response — this will be passed back to you next round.
ARIS_MEMORY_INSTRUCTIONS
} > "$PROMPTFILE"
copilot --agent "$REVIEWER_PROFILE" --model "$REVIEWER_MODEL" \
  --effort xhigh --allow-tool=read --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPTFILE")"
# ARIS_ROUND2_COPILOT_END
```

**IMPORTANT:** This is architecturally different from `SendMessage` (which would require a persistent subagent handle that `copilot --agent` does not provide). The memory-artifact pattern is the documented alternative for stateful multi-round workflows in Copilot CLI.

### Known Limitations & Upstream Dependencies

| Capability | Codex MCP | Copilot `--agent` + profiles | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| Task spawning | `mcp__codex__codex` | `copilot --agent` subprocess (documented Copilot CLI form) | **Verified** — in Copilot CLI docs |
| Model pinning | `gpt-6-astra` param | Profile model repeated as subprocess `--model` | **Verified** — prevents Auto-session inheritance |
| Cross-model family | Configurable (agy, manual, llm-chat) | Router picks opposite-family profile from declared executor model | **Route verified; executor identity unverified** |
| Thread continuity | `codex-reply` (threadId) | New `copilot --agent` call + `review-stage/REVIEWER_MEMORY.md` artifact | **Verified** — memory-artifact pattern |
| Reasoning effort control | `xhigh` / `ultra` tiers | Subprocess `--effort xhigh` | **Verified** — capability-gated before review |
| File reading | Reads listed files | Can read files via restricted custom-agent tools | **Verified** — profile + `--allow-tool=read` |
| Review tracing | `.aris/traces/` schema | Same schema + model sources/family relation | **Verified with explicit identity limit** |

**What is verified vs assumed:**

| Assertion | Status | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `copilot --agent NAME --prompt "..."` invocation form | **Verified** | Live Copilot CLI testing; documented subprocess form |
| Custom agent profiles (`.agent.md` files) discovered automatically | **Verified** | `.github/agents/` convention documented, `.agent.md` extension confirmed |
| Profile pins model in frontmatter | **Verified** | Agent profile format from Copilot CLI docs |
| `copilot --agent` runs synchronously | **Verified** | Returns response to stdout; confirmed by live testing |
| Memory-artifact multi-round pattern | **Verified** | `review-stage/REVIEWER_MEMORY.md` carries state between fresh subprocesses |
| Reasoning effort for Copilot | **Verified** | Explicit subprocess `--effort xhigh`; unsupported CLIs fail closed |
| Compatibility-drive parent executor model | **Unverified** | `--executor-model` is caller-declared on this legacy path; native mode instead uses host session events |
| Native end-to-end acceptance without MCP/manual | **Provided for `copilot-native`** | Verified host event evidence + cross-family rubber-duck verdict enters the executable stop gate directly |

### Invariants

- With no reviewer directive, a bound Copilot root session defaults to
  `copilot-native`; an unbound/non-Copilot host defaults to Codex. Explicit
  reviewer directives always win.
- `--reviewer: copilot` is an **explicit compatibility drive mode**. It is not
  the native default and its positive verdict still requires a finalizer.
- `--executor-model` is **MANDATORY** when `--reviewer: copilot` is used. Fail closed if missing.
- **Opposite-family route is mandatory** relative to the caller-declared executor model. Same/unknown family → `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`; a different relation is recorded as `independence_verified: "unverified"`, not as attestation.
- **Compatibility review floor:** custom-agent subprocess calls pin `xhigh` and
  remain drive-only. This restriction does not apply to verified native
  rubber-duck calls, whose actual model pair comes from host events.
- Custom agent profile models are repeated with subprocess `--model`; do not rely on profile-only pinning under an Auto session.
- Explicit reviewer directives (`codex`, `oracle-pro`, `agy`, `manual`) are separate from copilot.
- Reviewer independence protocol still applies (pass file paths, not summaries).
- `effort` and `difficulty` are orthogonal — they don't change the reviewer backend.
- If `copilot` CLI is unavailable → `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` for an explicitly
  requested compatibility drive round. The no-flag route uses the native
  activation/fallback rules above.
- If executor family is unknown → `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` (fail closed).
- NEVER fabricate a review verdict without an actual reviewer call.

### Using Codex Instead of Copilot

Pass `--reviewer: codex` to force Codex MCP instead of attempting the native
Copilot default. Outside a bound Copilot CLI session, Codex remains the no-flag
default.
